# ðŸ“¦ NestJS â€“ CLI & Project Setup

NestJS comes with a **powerful CLI (Command Line Interface)** that makes scaffolding, generating, and managing your project faster and easier â€” similar to `create-next-app` in Next.js.

---

# Why Use NestJS CLI?

1. **Easy Project Scaffolding**

   * Create full NestJS project in one command.

2. **Built-in Schematics (Templates)**

   * Generate files like modules, controllers, services, etc., instantly with proper wiring.

3. **Time Saver**

   * No need to manually write boilerplate code.

4. **Consistency**

   * Ensures your folder structure and code follow best practices.

---

# Step 1: Install NestJS CLI Globally

Use `npm` to install Nest CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

> âœ… Installing globally lets you use `nest` command from anywhere.

---

# Step 2: Verify CLI Installation

After installation, you can verify it with:

```bash
nest -v
```

* Shows current CLI version (e.g., `11.x`).

Use `nest --help` to see all available commands:

```bash
nest --help
```

Example of available commands:

| Command          | Description                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `new`            | Create a new Nest project                    |
| `generate` / `g` | Generate files (module, controller, service) |
| `build`          | Build the app                                |
| `start`          | Start the development server                 |

---

# Step 3: Create a New Project

Create a new NestJS project using:

```bash
nest new project-name
```

Example:

```bash
nest new nestjs-lms
```

> ðŸ”„ This command will:
>
> * Scaffold a new project.
> * Ask for your preferred package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn).
> * Automatically install dependencies.

---

# Step 4: Run the Project

After creation:

```bash
cd nestjs-lms
pnpm run start  # or npm run start
```

> âœ… This starts your local NestJS server at `http://localhost:3000`

---

# Step 5: Open in Code Editor

You can now open the project in VS Code or any editor:

```bash
code .
```

# Nest CLI: Generate Files Using Schematics

CLI includes **schematics** (a.k.a. blueprints or templates):

| To Generate | Command                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Module      | `nest g module module-name`         |
| Controller  | `nest g controller controller-name` |
| Service     | `nest g service service-name`       |

Example:

```bash
nest g controller auth
```

> ðŸ§  Auto-generates the controller file and updates the corresponding module file.

No need to manually:

* Create the file
* Export/import the class
* Register it in the module

---

# Why This Matters

âœ… Saves **a ton of time**
âœ… Keeps **code clean and consistent**
âœ… Helps you focus on **business logic**, not boilerplate

---

# Summary

> Nest CLI is your best friend when working with NestJS.

* Use `nest new` to scaffold projects
* Use `nest generate` to create new features instantly
* All commands come with smart wiring
* Choose your package manager and get going fast
* Code structure and files follow industry standards
