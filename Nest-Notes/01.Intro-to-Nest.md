# What is [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)?

* **NestJS** is a **progressive Node.js framework** for building efficient, reliable, and scalable **server-side applications**.
* Built with **TypeScript** by default.
* Inspired by **Angular**, it uses a **modular architecture** and supports **OOP**, **FP**, and **FRP**.
* Designed for building both **monoliths** and **microservices** with ease.

# Why Do We Need NestJS – Express.js Limitations

## Problems With Just Using Express.js

1. **Not Scalable by Default**

   * Works great for small apps.
   * Becomes hard to maintain as the app grows.

2. **Minimal Framework**

   * Express is just a routing library.
   * Lacks structure and opinionated architecture.

3. **No Built-in Folder Structure**

   * Developers must manually create scalable architecture.

4. **Manual Wiring**

   * Authentication, Authorization, Middlewares, Error Handling, etc., need manual setup.

5. **No Built-in Validation or Logging**

   * You must use external libraries or build your own.

6. **No Built-in Dependency Injection (DI)**

   * Makes unit testing harder and code less modular.

7. **Too Much Time on Configuration**

   * Developers spend more time setting up boilerplate than writing business logic.

# How NestJS Solves These Problems

1. **Out-of-the-box Architecture**

   * Comes with predefined structure (Modules, Controllers, Services, etc.)

2. **Built-in CLI Tool**

   * Generate files like modules/controllers/services quickly.
   * Helps scaffold projects in seconds.

3. **Dependency Injection**

   * Built-in DI system like Angular.
   * Makes testing and modular code easier.

4. **TypeScript Support**

   * Full TypeScript support for type safety and better DX.

5. **Decorators and Metadata**

   * Uses decorators (`@Module`, `@Controller`, etc.) for intuitive structure.

6. **Built-in Features**

   * Exception filters, pipes, guards, interceptors.
   * All help reduce boilerplate code.

7. **Built-in Support for Express & Fastify**

   * Express is default, Fastify is optional and configurable.

8. **Support for REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, and Microservices**

   * Flexible enough to handle any server-side use case.

# Project Overview – What Are We Building?

We’ll build a **REST API** for a **Learning Management System (LMS)** using NestJS.

## Key Features

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**

* **Register API**
* **Login API**
* **JWT Token Authentication**
* **Get Profile API**
* **Authorization using Roles (e.g., Admin)**

### 2. **CRUD Operations for Courses**

* Create Course
* Read Course(s)
* Update Course
* Delete Course

### 3. **Protected Routes**

* Only authenticated users can access certain APIs.
* Only admins can create/update/delete courses.

# Tools & Stack

| Component   | Tool                 |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Framework   | NestJS               |
| Runtime     | Node.js              |
| Language    | TypeScript           |
| Web Server  | Express.js (default) |
| Database    | MongoDB              |
| Client/Test | Postman/Browser      |

* NestJS uses Express under the hood by default.
* You can switch to **Fastify** for better performance.

---

# Philosophy & Design

* **Focus on Business Logic**, not configuration.
* Let NestJS handle the plumbing.
* Inspired heavily by **Angular** – if you know Angular, NestJS will feel familiar.
* Supports **Modularization** → makes code easy to scale and maintain.

---

# Getting Started

* Visit: [https://nestjs.com](https://nestjs.com)
* CLI: `npm i -g @nestjs/cli`
* Start a new project with:

  ```bash
  nest new project-name
  ```
